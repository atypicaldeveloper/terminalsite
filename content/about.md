Hi, my name is Arya - Computer hobbyist and digital rights activist from Colorado

I love exploring technologies and pushing my current understanding of them.

Productivity-centric and efficiency-obsessive, activism for üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è rights.

My ultimate goal for this and consecutive projects is to lay the foundation for freedom and access of information. Freedom of information is an undeniable and morally fundamental right in which the basis of the internet thrives. By advocating for a world where information is freely accessible, I am to cultivate a more informed technological society.

## Stuff I'm into:

- Sociological studies
  - Social media and its effects on agents of socialization
  - Perspectives on LGBTQ+ communities, and the ramifications of Taboos
- Computer Science
- Cyber Security
- Writing

## Contact Me

- Coming soon, I don't use many social medias and haven't setup my email yet!

## Deep Dive // About Arya

I decided to take a different approach than I normally would to my about section, where I'll be answering questions I find interesting.

1. **What inspired you to pursue a hobby in technology?**

    I've always had a special interest in the way computers, (more specifically, operating systems and programs on them) worked. My fascination led to many late nights exploring the inner-workings of my Windows XP's vast ocean of complex systems working together. When I was young, I was prone to breaking sh*t. That, in my opinion is the best way to learn, and that lead to my interest in teaching others about technology. **Helping others understand what I understand is one of the most fulfilling feelings I've ever had.**

2. **How has technology impacted your life and the world around you?**

    There are no words that I can use to describe just how intertwined I am with technology. On a daily basis I'm on the lookout to learn something new, have something fresh and of my own creation. So profoundly, the technologies of today have changed the world, and have changed our perception of it irreversibly, (for better or worse). The speed at which things are progressing fascinates me, and I've always been on the cutting edge of new software, resulting in my fast-track to a better understanding of the world around me.

3. **What is your favorite aspect of technology and why?**

    I like to imagine technology as an infinite marble track, progressing ever forwards, rolling with limitless potential. There's always something new, something fresh to pick up and toy with. I love being able to flesh out idea and turn it into reality, all due to technology.

4. **What exciting projects have you been working on recently?**

    I'm making a game! I won't get into too much detail here, but it's exciting enough that I plan to make development update posts along the way. Stay tuned!
