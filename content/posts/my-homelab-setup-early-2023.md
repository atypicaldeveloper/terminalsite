A homelab is a personal laboratory setup for experimenting and learning with technology, oftentimes in a home office environment. This technology can vary anywhere from servers to virtualization software - two technologies I'm using in my setup that host and control my services respectively - and can be of any size. Homelabs are often used by technology enthusiasts, IT professionals, and students to gain hands-on experience with new technologies, test out configurations and setups, or develop and host their own applications and websites. The goal of a homelab is typically to gain a deeper understanding of this realm, and it's generally much less than a production environment.
