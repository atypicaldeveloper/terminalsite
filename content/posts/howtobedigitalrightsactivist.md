*A Room of One's Own* is an essay by Virginia Woolf, which explores woman's rights in tenth century America. In it, she uses devices such as metaphor to delve into exactly what it means to have your identity supressed. During the time, there was a distinct lack of fiction authored by woman. This wasn't due to a lack of skill but instead a lack of oppertunity.
