> ## "Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather."

Technology isn't a tool for wealthy silicon-valley oncelers. A spectacle not unfamiliar to those knowing all too well, and a reality some legislatures have yet to understand. It is imperative that one learns that it is more. Much more. I fight every day to ensure that it stays in the hands of the many, not the few.

It is a tool for good, for progress, for making the world more accessible for all. It has the power to revolutionize industries, to solve complex problems, and to shift the paradigm away from lock and key. Who's to prevent progression but those at the helm? Close-source and black-box - terms that describe the closing-off of information, usually for profit - are colloquial with the fight for freedom, and are often used to criticize the industry and its disinformation practices... but today I wish to teach you a new word (and maybe you've heard it before): Digital Freedom.

Open-source refers to the concept of making everything about a program or system free to use and to manipulate. This concept has revolutionized the way we think about technology and information, giving back the helm to the individual, allowing for more collaboration and more innovation. The open-source movement promotes transparency, collaboration, and especially **Digital Freedom** in a world whose entanglement with  technology, has driven a philosophy that has made much of the technological progress we've witnessed in recent memory possible.

By sharing information and knowledge, the open-source movement has allowed for the developments we take for granted today. From the operating systems we use on our computers to the websites we visit, open-source technology has changed the way we interact with the world. The internet, once a tool of the military, has become a global network of knowledge and information, connecting people from any walk of life. The open-source philosophy is to build on each other's work, creating something new and better.

The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace is not just a call to action for the tech industry, but for all of us. It is a call to embrace the principles of freedom, transparency, and collaboration. It is a call to use technology as a tool for good, and to strive towards a world that is more equitable and just.

Let us not forget that the internet and technology are not just things, but they are a manifestation of our collective dreams and aspirations. They are a reflection of our values, our beliefs, and our hopes for the future. And so, let us work to ensure that they reflect the best of who we are, and what we can be.

In the end, this is what Digital Freedom truly represents: a call to action, a call to create a better world, and a call to unlock the full potential of technology for the betterment of all humanity.
