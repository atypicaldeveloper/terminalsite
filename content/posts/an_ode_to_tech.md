> ## "Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather."

To the weary, tech is a tool for wealthy silicon-valley oncelers. A spectacle not unfamiliar to those knowing all to well, and a reality the majority has yet to understand in terms of the programmer or the engineer. But, and to my best understanding, it is so much more. Much, much more.

It is a tool for good, for progress, and for making the world a better place. It has the power to revolutionize industries, to solve complex problems, and to improve the lives of millions of people. Who's to prevent this but those at the helm. Close-source and closed-box are terms colloquial with those familiar, and are often used to criticize the industry and its malevolent practices... but today I wish to teach you a new word (and maybe you've heard it before): Freedom.

Open-source refers to the concept of making the code, documentation, philosophies and knowledge of an utility, application, game, system, standard etc. This concept has revolutionized the way we think about technology and information, giving people greater control over their technology and allowing for more collaboration and innovation. The open-source movement promotes transparency, collaboration, and especially **freedom** in the world of technology, and it is this philosophy that has driven much of the technological progress we've witnessed in recent memory.

By sharing information and knowledge, the open-source movement has allowed for the development of many of the technologies we take for granted today. From the operating systems we use on our computers to the websites we visit, open-source technology has changed the way we interact with the world. The internet, once a tool of the military, has become a global network of knowledge and information, connecting people from all over the world. And it is because of the open-source nature of the web that we are able to build on each other's work, creating new and exciting things.

And so, we must strive to ensure that access to technology is not just reserved for the wealthy and privileged, but that it is available to all. We must work towards creating a world where technology is used to bring people together, to promote equality, and to create a better future for all.

We must not be discouraged by the challenges and obstacles that lie ahead. We must stand up for what is right, and fight to ensure that technology remains a tool for the masses, not just a spectacle for the few. For, only then, can we truly unlock the full potential of technology, and harness its power for the betterment of all humanity.

> -> [A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace by John Perry Barlow](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)

The declaration of independence of Cyberspace is not just a call to action for the tech industry, but for all of us. It is a call to embrace the principles of freedom, transparency, and collaboration that have driven so much of our technological progress. It is a call to use technology as a tool for good, and to strive towards a world that is more equitable and just.

Let us not be passive spectators in this new era of technological revolution, but let us actively work to shape it for the better. Let us work towards creating a world where technology is accessible to all, and where it is used to bring people together, to promote equality, and to create a better future for all.

Let us not forget that the internet and technology are not just things, but they are a manifestation of our collective dreams and aspirations. They are a reflection of our values, our beliefs, and our hopes for the future. And so, let us work to ensure that they reflect the best of who we are, and what we can be.

In the end, this is what the declaration of independence of Cyberspace truly represents: a call to action, a call to create a better world, and a call to unlock the full potential of technology for the betterment of all humanity.
